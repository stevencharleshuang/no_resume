2012 – By 2012, the number of large companies using ATS software to sort résumés was in the high 90% range. Nearly every Fortune 500 company used one, and the software continued to kick out up to half of all incoming applications based on the parsing of specific keywords. Many ATS programs now assigned a ranking, letting hiring managers and recruiters immediately start from the “top of the pile,” so to speak. All of the technology made it even harder to get noticed when applying for a job.

Thus, industry insiders admitted that a job seeker’s best chance of landing an interview and getting hired was through personal referral and networking rather than by simply submitting a résumé. Websites like LinkedIn made this type of relationship-based approach much easier.

2013 – Microsoft published an interesting study in May 2013. The findings indicated our attention spans have shrunk by a full 4 seconds, from 12 seconds in 2000 to just eight seconds in 2013. The latest trend in résumé writing was coinciding with this realization, with shorter, more “tweet-like” phrases taking the place of longer paragraphs.

This also brought a more streamlined, result-oriented way of presenting work experience. Previous years had seen the bullet point approach listing job responsibilities and some accomplishments. The newest formula of 2013 was “Problem à Solution à Result.” The goal was to show how a candidate could bring results to the bottom line of a company by demonstrating—with examples—an ability to recognize a problem, brainstorm a solution, and then effectively follow through.

This year also began to relive the same debate from the mid-1980s, whether the résumé was dying, already dead or just simply evolving. The general consensus was the need to show rather than tell. The traditional résumé was quickly becoming “boring” and never told the whole story. Instead, using online, multimedia portfolios, either with a personal website or LinkedIn, was seen as the true future of the résumé.

Still, some recruiters felt these sites were too restrictive. A candidate could always paint himself or herself in the best light. Googling and researching job seekers was still the best way for recruiters to get the full picture.

The Society of Human Resource Managers reported 53% of résumés and job applications contained “falsifications,” while an astounding 78% contained information categorized as “misleading.” These findings included listing fake degrees or certifications, incorrect employment dates, inflated job descriptions and even falsified references.

A full 70% of college students admitted they would lie on a résumé to get a job, making recruiters more suspicious of résumés than ever before.
